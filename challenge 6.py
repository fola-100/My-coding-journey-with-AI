#ðŸŽ¯ Challenge: Word Guess Game (like Hangman but simpler)
#Goal
#Create a program where the computer picks a random word, and the player must guess it letter by letter.
#Requirements
#Word Bank:
#Have a list of words (at least 5).
#The program randomly chooses one.
#Display progress:
#Show the word as underscores _ _ _ at the start.
#As the user guesses letters correctly, fill them in.
#Attempts:
#Easy mode â†’ 10 attempts.
#Hard mode â†’ 5 attempts.
#Each wrong guess reduces attempts.
#Win/Loss conditions:
#If the player fills all letters, they win ðŸŽ‰.
#If attempts run out, they lose ðŸ˜¢.
#Replay option:
#After the game ends, ask if they want to play again.
#(Optional Upgrade):
#Keep a simple scoreboard: how many games won vs lost.
#My Attempts
