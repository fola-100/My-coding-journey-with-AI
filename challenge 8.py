#warm-up challenge:
#Daily Journal App (Beginner File Project)
#Goal
#Create a simple journal program where you can:
#Add a new entry (append it to a text file).
#Read all previous entries (display everything in the file).
#Write a program that:
#Opens (or creates) a file called "journal.txt".
#If user picks 1, asks for input and appends it to the file.
#If user picks 2, reads and prints all entries.
#If user picks 3, exits.
#Keeps running until user chooses exit
print("Welcome to your Daily Journal")
while True:
     print("\n")
     print("1.) Add new entry")
     print("2.) View all entries")
     print("3.)Exit")
     #input checker
     choice = input("Enter your choice:")
     if choice=="1":
        with open("journal.txt","a")as file:
            file.write(input("Write your journal entry:"))
            print("journal entry has been saved. successfully.")
     elif choice=="2":
          with open("journal.txt","r") as file:
              file=file.read()
              print(file)
     elif choice=="3":
          print("Goodbye")
          break
     else:
         print("invalid choice,pls enter the option accessible.")
#AI Correction 
#üî• That‚Äôs a great warm-up, and your code is clean, working, and well-organized.
#You‚Äôve nailed

#update Challenge
#üß† New Features to Add
#Multiple Pages (Topics)
#Each ‚Äúpage‚Äù is a separate text file, e.g.
#ideas.txt
#goals.txt
#dreams.txt
#notes.txt
#Switch Pages
#User can ‚Äúflip‚Äù to another file (topic) to write or read entries there.
#View Current Page
#Display which topic (file) they‚Äôre currently writing in.

 #AI CORRECTION 
#1Ô∏è‚É£ Tiny Typo in File Extension (line under elif choice == "3":)
#You wrote:
#with open(name+"txt.", "a") as file:
#That‚Äôs missing the dot before ‚Äútxt‚Äù.
#‚úÖ Correct version:
#with open(name + ".txt", "a") as file:
#üß© 2Ô∏è‚É£ Lower/Upper Case Mismatch
#You‚Äôre converting names to lowercase when reading:
#name = input("Enter the page in the journal you are looking for:").strip().lower()
#‚Ä¶but not when creating the file:
#name = input("What name do you want to save the page has:")
#That means if you create a file like ‚ÄúDreams.txt‚Äù, but later search for ‚Äúdreams‚Äù,
#Python won‚Äôt find it on systems that are case-sensitive (like Linux or macOS).
#‚úÖ Easiest fix ‚Äî keep it consistent:
#name = input("What name do you want to save the page has:").strip().lower()
#üß† Optional Improvement (Just for clarity)
#You might want to print a short message after creating or appending to confirm the file name:
#print(f"'{name}.txt' has been saved successfully.")
