#Here’s Weather Journal – Challenge 1 (Basic Edition):
#🧩 Challenge 1: Weather Logger
#Goal:
#Create a small program that lets the user enter today’s weather and saves it in a file called weather_log.txt.
#Requirements:
#Ask the user for:
#The date (you can also auto-generate it if you want using datetime).
#The temperature (in Celsius).
#A short description of the weather (e.g., “Sunny”, “Rainy”, “Windy”).
#Save the info to a file weather_log.txt in this format:
#2025-10-05 | 30°C | Sunny
#Each time the program runs, it should add a new entry (not overwrite the old ones)
