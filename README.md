My coding journey with AI (ChatGPT)
This repository documents my Python learning journey since July 2025.  

I post:  
- Coding challenges  
- My first attempts (with mistakes)  
- Corrected versions after feedback from my AI tutor (ChatGPT)  

So far, Iâ€™ve learned:  
- Variables & print()  
- Data types: int, float, str, bool  
- input() and type conversion with int() and float()  
- String formatting with f-strings  
- Operators & conditions: if, elif, else, and, or, not, <, <=, >, >=  
- Loops  
- Functions  
- Lists  
- Error handling & file handling
