#Here‚Äôs Weather Journal ‚Äì Challenge 1 (Basic Edition):
#üß© Challenge 1: Weather Logger
#Goal:
#Create a small program that lets the user enter today‚Äôs weather and saves it in a file called weather_log.txt.
#Requirements:
#Ask the user for:
#The date (you can also auto-generate it if you want using datetime).
#The temperature (in Celsius).
#A short description of the weather (e.g., ‚ÄúSunny‚Äù, ‚ÄúRainy‚Äù, ‚ÄúWindy‚Äù).
#Save the info to a file weather_log.txt in this format:
#2025-10-05 | 30¬∞C | Sunny
#Each time the program runs, it should add a new entry (not overwrite the old ones)
#My attempts
import datetime
temperature=int(input("Enter weather condition in Celsius:"))
print("\nWeather description available")
print("Sunny","Rainy","Windy")
weather_description=input("Enter weather description").lower().strip()
while weather_description not in ['sunny','rainy','windy']:
    print("Enter the three weather description available")
    weather_description=input("Enter weather description")
auto_generate=datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%y,%m,%d')
with open("weather_log.txt","a") as file:
    file.write(f'{auto_generate},{temperature},{weather_description}')
    print(f'Weather date {auto_generate},temperature {temperature},and description {weather_description} has been saved')
#AI corrections
#Date format
#You used '%y,%m,%d', which adds commas.
#Example: 25,10,05
#It‚Äôs better to use '%Y-%m-%d' ‚Üí 2025-10-05, easier to read.
#File formatting
#Right now, all logs might appear on one line since there‚Äôs no newline (\n).
#Add \n before writing the entry.
#User experience
#When asking for input, it‚Äôs good to add a space at the end (so it looks neat).

#üå§Ô∏è Challenge 2: View Past Weather Entries
#Challenge Description
#Write a Python program that:
#Asks the user to enter a date (in the format YYYY-MM-DD ‚Äî e.g., 2025-10-05).
#Opens the file weather_log.txt.
#Searches for lines that contain that date.
#If found ‚Äî print all matching entries.
#If not found ‚Äî show a message like "No record found for that date."
#Use a try-except block in case the file doesn‚Äôt exist yet.
#My Attempt

#AI CORRECTION 
#Excellent job, Olamide! You just built a two-feature weather journal ‚Äî one for logging and one for searching past entries.
#here are a few improvement or correction 
#Small Fix (Logic in history_checker)
#Inside your loop:
#‚û°Ô∏è The if not found: should be after the for loop, not inside it.
#Right now, it prints ‚ÄúNo record found‚Äù for every line that doesn‚Äôt match ‚Äî even if one later matches.
